My work stems from a desire to envision and facilitate powerful ways of knowing and engaging with the world through use of computational media, interactive technologies, and data. I often work with location based media and technologies, maps and data visualizations, and occasionally dabble on experimental audio-visual projects. My work has been exhibited at international festivals including ARCO MediaLabMadrid, Ars Electronica, Conflux, MUKHA, and The Centre for Contemporary Image in Geneva.

I previously cofounded [Timescape](https://timescape.io), was a Ford/MDF design & technology fellow at [Global Voices](https://globalvoices.org/), led design initiatives at [Ushahidi](https://www.ushahidi.com/) and Yahoo â€“ where I was also part of the design innovation team at Yahoo Brickhouse â€“ an early design and technology incubator. I'm a visiting faculty at [Srishti](http://srishti.ac.in/) School of Design where I teach courses at the intersections of design, media arts, technology and social justice. I am a graduate of the Interactive Telecommunications Program ([ITP](https://tisch.nyu.edu/itp)) at NYU, and Srishti School of Design and Technology, Bangalore.Â
