I work with enterprises, non-profits and startups in designing and building experiences that engage their communities in novel ways. I facilitate interdisciplinary groups to envision key product strategies and solutions that not only solve problems but also create new business and social impact opportunities through design and technology.

I cofounded Timescape, a map-based interactive storytelling platform. At Timescape we explore new forms of collaborative story-making and storytelling. Weâ€™ve enabled social enterprises and educational institutions like MIT, UNESCO, and WWF to build narrative driven crowdsourced maps that drive new types of envisioning activities with their communities. These interactive maps enable outreach and advocacy campaigns, collaborative research and social/environmental impact mapping.

I am interested in envisioning and facilitating powerful ways of knowing and engaging with the world through use of computational media, interactive technologies, and data. I often work with location based media and technologies, maps and data visualizations, and occasionally dabble on experimental audio-visual projects. My work has been exhibited at international festivals including ARCO MediaLabMadrid, Ars Electronica, Conflux, MUKHA, and The Centre for Contemporary Image in Geneva.

I previously led design initiatives at Yahoo and Ushahidi and was also part of the design innovation team at Yahoo Brickhouse â€“ an early design and technology incubator. I am a graduate of the Interactive Telecommunications Program (ITP) at NYU, and Srishti School of Design and Technology, Bangalore.Â
