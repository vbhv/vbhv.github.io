ðŸ‘‹

I am interested in envisioning and facilitating powerful ways of knowing and engaging with the world through use of computational media, interactive technologies, and data. I often work with location based media and technologies, maps and data visualizations, and occasionally dabble on experimental audio-visual projects. My work has been exhibited at international festivals including ARCO MediaLabMadrid, Ars Electronica, Conflux, MUKHA, and The Centre for Contemporary Image in Geneva.

I previously cofounded [Timescape](https://timescape.io), led design initiatives at Yahoo and Ushahidi and was also part of the design innovation team at Yahoo Brickhouse â€“ an early design and technology incubator. I am a graduate of the Interactive Telecommunications Program (ITP) at NYU, and Srishti School of Design and Technology, Bangalore.Â
