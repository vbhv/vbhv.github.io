üëãüèæ

My work stems from a desire to envision and facilitate powerful ways of knowing and engaging with the world through use of computational media, interactive technologies, and data.

I help enterprises, non-profits, and think-tanks to design and build interfaces that engender creativity and problem solving. A considerable amount of my work and expertise has to do with designing and building rich interactive systems that leverage collaboration and data visualisation.

I'm particularly interested in collaborations that explore the use of interactive media, data visualizations and collaborative interfaces for public interest projects.

I previously cofounded [Timescape.io](https://twitter.com/timescaping){:target="_blank"}, was a Ford/MDF design & technology fellow at [Global Voices](https://globalvoices.org/), led design initiatives at [Ushahidi](https://www.ushahidi.com/), and Yahoo ‚Äì where I was also part of the design innovation team at Yahoo Brickhouse ‚Äì an early design and technology incubator.

I am a graduate of the Interactive Telecommunications Program (ITP) at NYU, and Srishti School of Design and Technology, Bangalore. I teach courses at the intersections of design, media arts, technology and social justice. My work has been exhibited at design and art festivals including TEDxBangalore, ARCO MediaLab Madrid, Ars Electronica, Conflux, MUKHA, and The Centre for Contemporary Image in Geneva.
