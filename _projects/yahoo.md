In mid 2011, as part of the Yahoo! Design Team, I worked on a company wide initiative to envision a new cross device Yahoo experience. Our goal was to design a seamless and inspiring personal path for discovering and sharing content that leveraged social relationships as well as interests of the user. I was responsible for conceptualizing and designing a personalization experience that engaged the user with byte-sized opportunities to make their reading experiences serendipitous and relevant. A significant part of this exercise dealt with understanding and surfacing Yahooâ€™s personalization technology with help from the science and engineering teams.
