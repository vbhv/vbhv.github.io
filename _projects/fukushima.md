Citizens and institutions installed hundreds of Geiger counters across Japan after the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear reactors underwent a meltdown in the aftermath of the March 2011 tsunami. This was an unprecedented effort in crowdsourcing environmental data by and for citizens.

I created this real-time visualization to help assess the radiation levels using crowdsourced Geiger sensor readings from Pachube (now xively), an IoT data exchange.
