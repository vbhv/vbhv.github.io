The Lowlands project involved mapping my neighborhood communities, professions and individuals with the aim of eliciting hidden or unspoken territories and behaviors. By collaborating with local participants in building maps, I was able to discover how they interacted with and experienced their neighborhood in unique ways. Each of the maps shown below are a result of many walks, bicycle rides and conversations with individuals that included senior citizens, push cart vendors, construction workers and temple priests.
