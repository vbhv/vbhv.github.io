Udder Utter is a gesture based audio-visual instrument. It's playability is inspired by the gestures involved in milking a cow. Playing the instrument primarily involves manipulating syllabic sound samples and a reactive visual system using gestures. The sounds produced by this instrument are intended to be a mix of discrete and continuous sounds allowing the player to explore rhythmic qualities of the spoken word.

I see the Udder as an instrument for both, constructing and rupturing meaning by combining primitive sounds to construct words and by manipulating formal elements of an image. This instrument was produced as part of the New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME) class at ITP.
