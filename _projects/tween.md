Tween is an exploratory visualization tool to seek out topical conversations on Yahoo! Answers site. It allows one to use a word as a starting point for exploring conversations on the Y! Answers site. It's intended to be used as a tool to discover the zeitgeistâ€“ the spirit of the times. It uses wordnet (a lexical database) to curate and to help build upon the results returned from Yahoo! Answers. The results are visualized using Processing. Tween was realized during an internship at the Yahoo! Design Innovation Group (yHaus-Brickhouse) during summer of 2007.
