Ushahidi is a non-profit technology company that builds open source platforms to help citizens, journalists, organizations, governments, and others gather, manage, analyze, and visualize crowdsourced data. I lead the design and implementation of a number of data visualisation initiatives at Ushahidi.

### Ushahidi Tracker
The Ushahidi Tracker aggregates all publicly available data from Ushahidi deployments from all over the world making it easy for anyone to analyze this massive stream of crowdsourced data. It is meant to give journalists, data scientists, developers, and other makers fast, easy access to critical humanitarian, and crowdsourced information. Read more about it on the [Ushahidi blog](https://www.ushahidi.com/blog/2015/10/06/ushahidi-tracker-visualising-reports-using-crisisnet-1).

### Ushahidi Platform
The new Ushahidi Platform allows anyone to easily deploy a crowdsourced mapping initiative from Ushahidi's website. It has powerful set of capabilities required to manage steady streams of crowdsourced information. Historically, there has been a great deal of interest from users for data visualisations that allow for in-depth analysis of incoming reports and other associated activity within their deployment. We set out to design and build a set of capabilities that would allow users to understand the incoming data to better manage their initiative, as well as to find stories and trends in the data that could be leveraged for advocacy and outreach.
