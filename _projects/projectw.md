Project W serves as a comprehensive data hub for Water, Sanitation, and Health (WASH) initiatives worldwide. Developed by [The Aquaya Institute](https://aquaya.org/project-w/), this platform addresses critical data gaps in the WASH sector by creating a bridge between data curation, analysis, and actionable insights. The hub empowers stakeholders to make informed decisions for WASH projects through centralized, accessible data resources.
